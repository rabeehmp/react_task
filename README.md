# React Task Submission

I've completed the task of setting up a React application using Vite for an enhanced development experience, as per the instructions provided.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12.x or newer) is installed on your system.

## Setup and Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Use `git clone https://repository-url.git` to clone the project locally.
2. **Install Dependencies**
   - run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. **Start the Development Server**
   - Execute `npm run dev` to launch the server. Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Technologies

- **Vite**: For fast and lean project builds.
- **React.js**: To build dynamic UIs efficiently.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Compiles the app for production.

  Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
